# About the Project
Rattler Ride addresses the current gap in transportation options, where city scooters are prohibited, and walking or using the FAMU Venom shuttle may be inefficient or inaccessible for navigating FAMUâ€™s campus. With FAMU students being the target audience, rattler Ride will serve a diverse college market that includes undergraduate and graduate students and faculty, specifically those who face strict time constraints from their school schedule, physical mobility issues, or students simply seeking more convenient means to get around campus. A standout feature of the Rattler Ride service will be integrating the current tap-to-pay system using a FAMU ID to allow for a seamless and efficient rental process for students, eliminating additional payment methods, unlike city scooters. Also, to facilitate scooter rentals and improve overall user experience rattler Ride plans to integrate this service into a mobile application. Through the mobile application, students could locate available scooters, view nearby parking and charging stations, and manage their scooter rentals within the app. Rattler Ride is exploring two options for this potential integration: incorporating the scooter rental system into the existing FAMU mobile application or developing a standalone mobile application for FAMU students. The Rattler Ride mobile application will ensure a seamless user experience, provide real-time information and convenience, and will be a crucial component in making the scooter service accessible for all users.
